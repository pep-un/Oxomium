<p><strong>Welcome to the Oxomium!</strong></p>

<p>This help guide is designed to ensure we have a common understanding of key concepts we use and a clear view of each section and how to use the features effectively.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Frameworks:</dt>
    <dd>Structured sets of requirements and guidelines designed to help organizations secure their information systems. Examples include ISO 27001, NIST, and CIS.</dd>

    <dt>Requirements:</dt>
    <dd>Specific criteria or conditions defined by a framework that an organization must meet to achieve compliance. Requirements outline what needs to be accomplished through the implementation of controls.</dd>

    <dt>Conformity Assessments:</dt>
    <dd>Evaluations conducted to determine how well an organization meets the requirements of a selected security framework. These assessments help identify areas of strength and potential gaps.</dd>

    <dt>Controls:</dt>
    <dd>Specific actions or safeguards implemented to manage risks and achieve compliance with security frameworks. Controls can be technical, administrative, or physical measures.</dd>

    <dt>Control Points:</dt>
    <dd>The execution instances of a control at a specific time. Control Points are where compliance and effectiveness of the controls are evaluated.</dd>

    <dt>Audits:</dt>
    <dd>Systematic evaluations of the effectiveness of controls and the overall security posture of the organization. Audits are used to ensure that the controls are operating as intended and to identify any areas for improvement.</dd>

    <dt>Actions:</dt>
    <dd>Corrective steps taken to address non-conformities or issues identified during audits or control assessments. Actions are tracked to ensure that problems are resolved promptly and effectively.</dd>
