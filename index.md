## Oxomium

Oxomium is designed to help cybersecurity team to handle the conformity of organizations regarding standard or internal policy.
It's design to be simple to use and avoid complex spreadsheets.

Oxomium is provided with a basic set of features at first but will be extended with time.

The OpenSource aspect is fundamental for me and will (I hope) help to improve the tool quickly with the feedback of several users.

### Conformity management

Oxomium is able to help you track your organization's conformity to security policy.
The policy could be a default one (ISO27001 and NIST are provided) or your own.

### Audit management

Oxomium allows you to register your audit and the findings associated.

### Roadmap

I have planned a road map to improve the tool progressively. I will use the GitHub milestones to show the progress of the development.

The plan for the next version is :
- [x] Add default dataset for ISO27001 and NIST policy
- [x] Management of the audit findings.
- [x] Support of Actions and Actions Plan attach to an audit findings, a non-conformity (or both).
- [ ] Executive dashboard and email notification for deadline management.
- [ ] Security survey for external supplier (with magic link).
- [ ] Support of manual Indicator (KPI).
- [ ] Support of automatic Indicator with automatic data gathering from API.
